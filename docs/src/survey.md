# Survey
The [`Survey`](@ref) type is the base level for constructing a survey in `LimeSurveyBuilder.jl`. The package offers multiple convenience constructors using the [`survey`](@ref) function depending on your preferred way to create surveys.

For a complete example on how to construct surveys in practice see the [Tutorials](@ref) section of this documentation.
