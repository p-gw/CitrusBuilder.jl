# LimeSurveyBuilder.jl

A tool to build *LimeSurvey* surveys within Julia. 

This documentation aims to get you up and running building your surveys in Julia using the LimeSurveyBuilder.jl package. 

If you are a new user of this package, have a look at the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page, which provides a quick overview on how to install and use this package. Afterwards you can work through the introductory tutorials, 

- [Construct basic surveys](tutorials/basic.md)
- [Construct multi-language surveys](tutorials/multi_language.md)

More advanced users are free to skip ahead to more advanced topics like

- [Construct surveys programmatically](tutorials/from_data.md)
- [Creating custom question types](tutorials/custom_question_types.md)

While not recommended for first-time users you can also skip the tutorials entirely and see the documentation for the LimeSurveyBuilder.jl API. The index below provides a full list of documented types and functions.
